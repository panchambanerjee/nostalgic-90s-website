> **Welcome to CyberSpace 1999!** 🚀 A lovingly crafted tribute to the golden age of the internet by Tom from MySpace, complete with dial-up sounds, dancing babies, and enough neon colors to make your retinas burn with nostalgia! 

## 🎯 What Is This Madness?

This project is a **pixel-imperfect recreation** of what the internet felt like in 1999 - when websites had soul, creativity ran wild, and every homepage was a unique digital snowflake! Experience the authentic chaos of:

- 🔗 **Authentic 56k dial-up connection simulation**
- 🐣 **Virtual Tamagotchi pet that needs your love**
- 📷 **Digital camera photo gallery simulation**
- **... and more!...**

## 🚀 Live Demo

**[🌐 Enter CyberSpace →](https://panchambanerjee.github.io/nostalgic-90s-website/)**

*Best viewed on Netscape Navigator 4.0 at 800x600 resolution* 😉

## 🛠️ Behind The Scenes

### **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript**
- No frameworks, no build process - just authentic web technologies
- Vanilla JavaScript with ES6+ features for modern functionality
- CSS animations and transforms for visual effects
- LocalStorage for persistent data (hit counter, pet care, user preferences)
- Web Audio API for procedural modem sounds and music generation

### **Performance Optimized**
- Efficient event handling and memory management
- CSS-based animations instead of resource-heavy GIFs
- Modular JavaScript architecture with class-based components
- Lazy initialization of complex features

### **Browser Compatibility**
- Works on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Graceful degradation for audio features
- Mobile-responsive while maintaining 90s table-based layout authenticity
